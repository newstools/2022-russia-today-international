Jon Reyes, a Canadian politician who serves as Manitoba’s minister of economic development, received heavy backlash after he publicly celebrated his wife for shoveling snow following a 12-hour hospital work shift. “Even after a 12 hour night shift at the hospital last night, my wife still has the energy to shovel the driveway,” Reyes tweeted, along with a photo of his wife shoveling snow outside their home. “God bless her and all our frontliners. Time to make her some breakfast.” Even after a 12 hour night shift at the hospital last night, my wife still has the energy to shovel the driveway. God bless her and all our frontliners. Time to make her some breakfast. 🙏🏽 pic.twitter.com/91vahySLqO— Jon Reyes (@jonreyes204) January 8, 2022 Even after a 12 hour night shift at the hospital last night, my wife still has the energy to shovel the driveway.

This tweet sucks,” one woman said, while model Scottie Beam wrote, “I hope she leaves you. Quickly.” Others accused Reyes of “humiliating” his wife and even offered to “pay for her divorce lawyer.” “Dude. Your wife is working 12 hour hospital shifts during a pandemic. She should be coming home to a shoveled driveway,” one angry comment read. Though Reyes’ other posts on Twitter also became inundated with criticism and jokes mocking the snow shovel post, the minister has not yet responded to the incident.
