Donald Trump’s ex-wife, Ivana, has died aged 73. The former president announced her death on Thursday, describing his wife of 16 years as “a wonderful, beautiful, and amazing woman.” Trump broke the news of Ivana’s death in a post on his Truth Social media platform. “I am very sad to inform all of those that loved her, of which there were many, that Ivana Trump has passed away at her home in New York City,” he wrote, adding that he and his three children with Ivana “were all so proud of her.” “Ivana Trump was a survivor. She fled from communism and embraced this country. She taught her children about grit and toughness, compassion and determination,” read a statement by the Trump family to ABC News shortly afterwards.
